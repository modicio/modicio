# modicio

A framework for entity modelling and management at runtime based on eternal subspace instances (ESI).

* The rendered ScalaDoc/JavaDoc generated by the CI pipeline is published [here](https://modicio.github.io/modicio-docs). The codi-documentation is maintained and extended continuously.
* A **Getting-Started** guide is available as part of the wiki [here](https://github.com/modicio/modicio/wiki/Getting-Started)

In its current version, this framework is realised as a prototypical implementation. Although it can already be used to develop simple end-user-driven applications, some issues are not addressed yet. For further information, have a look at the [Open Issues and Limitations](https://github.com/modicio/modicio/wiki/Open-Issues#open-issues-and-limitations) page part of the wiki. If a contribution adressing such an issue is considered, please contact the project team.

> This project was initally designed and contributed by Karl Kegel (KKegel) as part of the Master-Thesis *Deep Models at Runtime for User-Driven Flexible Systems* at TU-Dresden ([full text](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361725823_Deep_ModelsRuntime_for_User-Driven_Flexible_Systems)) under the name *codi-native*. The Framework goals and design are especially covered in the chapters *Problem-Space Analyis* and *Solution Concept*. Modicio was started from codi-native and strives to become a full user-driven runtime modelling framework.
