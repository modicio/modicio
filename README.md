# modicio

A framework for entity modelling and management at runtime based on eternal subspace instances (ESI).

* The rendered ScalaDoc/JavaDoc generated by the CI pipeline is published [here](https://modicio.github.io/modicio-docs). The codi-documentation is maintained and extended continuously.
* A **Getting-Started** guide is available as part of the wiki [here](https://github.com/modicio/modicio/wiki/Getting-Started)

In its current version, this framework is realised as a prototypical implementation. Although it can already be used to develop simple end-user-driven applications, some issues are not addressed yet. For further information, have a look at the [Open Issues and Limitations](https://github.com/modicio/modicio/wiki/Open-Issues#open-issues-and-limitations) page part of the wiki. If a contribution adressing such an issue is considered, please contact the project team.
