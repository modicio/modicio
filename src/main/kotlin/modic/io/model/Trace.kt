/**
 * The Trace is an optional part of a [Fragment] that contains change operations (deltas) that were performed to the
 * [Fragment] in the past.
 * The usage of the Trace is implementation specific and may be refined in future work.
 * In general, the Trace targets the Model, but could target Instance changes as well. The coarse idea is the following:
 * Each evolution step by the client (e.g. that increments the running version) produces a sequence of [Delta]s which
 * are added to the Trace. This allows going back in time (reverse operations) and helps to (re-)construct model
 * transformations between different variants and versions.
 * If a new Fragment is created from an existing one, the Trace of the new Fragment is emptied.
 *
 * Unlike a delta modes (see Ina Sch√§fer et al.) does a Trace not have the properties of a partially ordered set. A
 * Traces has the properties of a totally ordered set, i.e., a sequence of change operations.
